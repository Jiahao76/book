# Introduction

This is a book written by findingnothing. It will include the theoretical and practical aspects of the following topics:
1. Probability
2. Statistics
3. Econometrics
4. Time Series Analysis
5. Causal Inference
6. Machine Learning

Writing a book that contains all of the these contents is surly too ambitious. 
There are a lot of excellent textbooks, lectures, videos and papers in the world that teach these contents well.

Nevertheless, findingnothing loves summarizing knowledge in a way he likes. Thus here comes the book. I will be glad if anyone else find it useful.

This book will contain both the theoretical knowledge, which implies mathematical definitions, propositions, and proofs, and pratical methods, which implies Python code. It will be written in a way the author likes, but as a reader, you can skip to any part you are interested in.

I don't know how long will it take for me to write this book. Maybe it is way too ambitious. But still, thinking about this project already makes me excited.

Now let's get started!
