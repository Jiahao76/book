    "This is not an introductory course to Python. I will cover the basic syntax of Python. We will use it more as a tool to achieve our goal: to learn about probability, statistics, econometrics, times series analysis, causal inference and machine learning. If you are interested in learning Python more, you should look for some other materials. \n",
